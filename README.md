# Welcome To Parking Lot Problem
Sanjay is owner of couple of parking lots. Each Parking Lot has capacity of 100.
This parking lots are next to the Airport. Sanjay wants to create a Parking Lot
System that will allow the driver to quickly park the car so can easily catch flights
as well as un-park to get home quickly. For this to happen he wants the system to
do many things like
1. inform parking lot is full or open,
2. provide valet service for handicap drivers and others,
3. ability for driver to find car,
4. use parking strategy of even distribution between lots, or based on handicap
   drivers or based on large and small vehicles,
5. charge for parking based on time,
6. be compliant to police laws to easily locate vehicles based on number plate,
   make, colour, time when car was parked, etc
